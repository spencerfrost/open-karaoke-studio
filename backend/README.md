## Project Description

The backend of Open Karaoke Studio is a Flask-based RESTful API that handles the core logic of the application. It's responsible for:

* Receiving audio file uploads from the frontend.
* Orchestrating the audio separation process using Demucs.
* Managing the storage and retrieval of processed audio files.
* Providing information about the song library.
* Handling requests from the frontend and sending back appropriate responses.

## Technologies

* Python 3.10+
* Flask
* Demucs
* PyTorch
* numpy
* Celery (for asynchronous task processing in production - *Future Enhancement*)
* Flask-CORS (for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* pip

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend/app/` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend/app
    ```

2.  Start the Flask development server:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  The server will run on a local URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5123/`).

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

* **`POST /process`**:
    * Receives an audio file upload.
    * Initiates the audio separation process.
    * Returns a task ID or filename.
* **`GET /status/<filename>`**:
    * Retrieves the status of an audio processing task.
    * Returns the processing status (e.g., "pending," "processing," "success," "error").
* **`GET /songs`**:
    * Retrieves a list of processed songs in the library.
    * Returns an array of song objects.
* **`GET /download/<filename>`**:
    * Downloads a processed audio file (vocals or instrumental).

## Audio Processing

* The `app/audio.py` module contains the core audio processing logic.
* It utilizes the Demucs library to separate audio into vocal and instrumental tracks.
* The `separate_audio` function handles the Demucs processing.
* Error handling is implemented to manage potential issues during Demucs execution.
* (*Future Enhancement*) Asynchronous processing using Celery is recommended for production to prevent blocking the API.

## File Management

* The `app/file_management.py` module manages file and directory operations.
* It provides functions for:
    * Creating the song library directory.
    * Creating song-specific directories.
    * Saving uploaded audio files.
    * Retrieving lists of processed songs.
    * Generating paths for output files.

## Configuration

* The `app/config.py` module stores backend-specific configuration settings.
* Settings include:
    * Base directory for the song library.
    * Filenames for vocal and instrumental tracks.
    * Default Demucs model.
    * MP3 bitrate.
* Environment variables are recommended for sensitive configuration (e.g., database credentials).

## Error Handling

* The backend implements robust error handling.
* Appropriate HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure.
* JSON responses include error messages.
* Logging is used to record events and errors.

## Asynchronous Tasks (*Future Enhancement*)

* For production, Celery should be integrated to handle the Demucs processing tasks asynchronously.
* This will prevent the API from becoming unresponsive during long-running audio separation.
* A message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) is required for Celery.

## Testing

* Unit tests should be written to verify the functionality of the backend logic.
* Integration tests should be created to test the API endpoints.
* A testing framework like `pytest` can be used.

## Deployment

* The Flask backend can be deployed to various platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud).
* A production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) should be used.
* Environment variables should be configured securely.
