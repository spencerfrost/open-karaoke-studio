# Frontend Investigation Plan - Understanding Current State

**Purpose**: Systematically review the frontend codebase to understand what actually exists and works, rather than making incorrect assumptions.

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Investigator**: AI Assistant
**Goal**: Create accurate assessment of current frontend state and identify real next steps

## üéØ Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Core Application Structure

**Objective**: Understand the main application architecture and routing

1. **Review App.tsx** - Main application structure and routing setup
2. **Review routing configuration** - What pages exist and how navigation works
3. **Review main layout components** - How the app is structured visually
4. **Document page inventory** - What functionality is actually implemented

### Phase 2: Page-by-Page Functional Analysis

**Objective**: Understand what each page does and how well it works

1. **Library Page** - How users browse and interact with songs
2. **AddSong Page** - How song addition workflow works
3. **SongPlayer Page** - **IMPORTANT**: Document existing karaoke player functionality
4. **KaraokeQueue Page** - Current queue implementation state
5. **Settings Page** - Configuration options available
6. **Stage Page** - What this page does
7. **PerformanceControlsPage** - Audio/performance controls available

### Phase 3: Component Architecture Analysis

**Objective**: Map out component reuse issues and identify actual duplication

1. **Forms Audit** - All metadata/input forms across the app
2. **Display Components Audit** - All result/data display components
3. **Shared Components Review** - What's actually reusable vs duplicated
4. **Component Dependencies Map** - How components depend on each other

### Phase 4: Feature Functionality Assessment

**Objective**: Test what actually works vs what appears broken

1. **Audio Playback Testing** - How the karaoke player actually works
2. **Mobile Experience Testing** - Current mobile usability state
3. **Search Functionality** - What search features exist and work
4. **Real-time Features** - WebSocket integration status
5. **Processing Workflow** - End-to-end song processing experience

### Phase 5: Integration Points Analysis

**Objective**: Understand how frontend connects to backend

1. **API Integration Review** - How frontend calls backend endpoints
2. **State Management Review** - How application state is managed
3. **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time features implementation
4. **Error Handling** - How frontend handles backend errors

## üîç Investigation Questions to Answer

### About the Karaoke Player

- Does a working karaoke player already exist?
- What audio controls are available?
- How do users select and play songs?
- What's the current user experience for karaoke performance?

### About Mobile Experience

- What mobile functionality currently works?
- What specific mobile issues exist?
- How touch-friendly is the current interface?

### About Component Architecture

- Which components are actually duplicated vs reusable?
- What's the real scope of the component consolidation needed?
- Are there working patterns we should preserve?

### About Missing Features

- What's the real feature gap vs what works?
- What would be high-value additions to existing functionality?
- Where are the actual pain points for users?

## üìù Deliverables

### Investigation Report

A comprehensive document containing:

1. **Accurate Current State Assessment** - What actually exists and works
2. **Real Component Duplication Issues** - Specific problems, not assumptions
3. **Actual Feature Gaps** - Missing functionality vs working features
4. **Realistic Next Steps** - Based on real understanding of codebase
5. **Component Consolidation Plan** - Specific duplicated components to fix

### Corrected Project Priorities

- **Real Priority 1** - Based on actual missing functionality
- **Real Priority 2** - Component fixes that are actually needed
- **Real Priority 3** - Features that would add real value

## üöÄ Next Actions

1. **Start Investigation** - Begin systematic review of frontend files
2. **Document Findings** - Record actual state vs assumptions
3. **Correct Assessment** - Replace wrong assumptions with facts
4. **Identify Real Next Steps** - Based on actual codebase understanding

---

_This investigation plan acknowledges that previous assumptions were incorrect and aims to understand the actual current state of the mature, working karaoke application._
