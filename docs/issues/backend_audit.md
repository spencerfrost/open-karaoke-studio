# Backend Full Audit and Visualization

## Overview

The backend codebase requires a comprehensive audit and visualization to improve maintainability, identify obsolete/redundant files, and clarify how all components interact. This will help guide future refactoring and onboarding.
**Note:** In addition to the tasks below, every time we discover new information, changes, or discrepancies during this audit, we must also update the backend architecture documentation to ensure it always accurately represents the current state of the backend. This is a living process: the documentation should be improved and kept up to date as we go, not just after the audit is complete. This will improve maintainability, onboarding, and guide future refactoring.

## Tasks

### 1. **Inventory All Backend Files**

- Generate a complete file tree of the backend (e.g., `/backend/app/`).
- Categorize files by type (models, repositories, services, routers, schemas, utils, etc.).
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**

### 2. **Analyze File Roles and Interactions**

- For each file, document its purpose and main responsibilities.
- Map out how files/modules import or call each other.
- Identify entry points (e.g., API routers, main app).
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**

### 3. **Identify Redundant or Obsolete Files**

- Search for files that are not imported or used anywhere.
- Look for duplicate or deprecated logic.
- Note files with TODO, FIXME, or DEPRECATED comments.
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**

### 4. **Generate Dependency Graphs**

- Use tools (e.g., Pyreverse, Snakefood, Graphviz) to create:
  - UML class diagrams
  - Module/package dependency graphs
- Visualize import and call relationships.
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**

### 5. **Create a Visual Map/Diagram**

- Produce a comprehensive diagram showing how all backend components interact.
- Use color-coding for different relationship types (import, call, inherit, etc.).
- Prefer open formats (e.g., Graphviz `.dot`, PlantUML, or SVG/PNG exports).
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**

### 6. **Document Findings**

- Summarize redundant/obsolete files and recommend actions (refactor, remove, merge, etc.).
- Provide the generated diagrams and a brief explanation of the backend architecture.
- **Update the documentation with findings from this task.**
