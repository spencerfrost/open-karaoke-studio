# Frontend Technical Investigations

**Last Updated**: January 20, 2025  
**Status**: Active development - one remaining investigation  
**Archived Files**: See `/docs/archived/technical-investigations/frontend-additional/` for completed specifications

Final active frontend investigation building on completed song library browsing UX implementation.

## üìã Active Investigation

### üîç Search Enhancement  
- **[Fuzzy Search Dual Display Design](fuzzy-search-dual-display-design.md)** - Advanced search with song/artist dual display extending the completed library browsing UX

## üéØ Investigation Focus

### Current Priority: Advanced Search Implementation

**Fuzzy Search Enhancement** - Building on the completed artist-accordion library browsing pattern, this investigation focuses on implementing comprehensive fuzzy search with dual display (songs + artists) to address the core karaoke use case where users search for specific songs rather than browsing by artist.

This represents the final frontend UX investigation, extending the recently completed library browsing improvements with advanced search capabilities.
