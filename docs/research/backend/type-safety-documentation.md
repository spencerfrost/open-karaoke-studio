[INCOMPLETE] The project does not yet fully meet the requirements for type safety and documentation improvements. Several backend modules lack comprehensive type hints and docstrings, API documentation is incomplete, and not all endpoints or models are fully documented or validated. See below for missing items and next steps.

# Type Safety & Documentation Improvements

## Issue Type
ðŸ“š **Documentation** / ðŸ”§ **Enhancement** | **Priority: Low** | **Effort: Medium**

## Summary
The codebase has made progress toward type safety and documentation, but gaps remain:
- Not all functions and methods have type hints or docstrings
- Some API endpoints lack OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and request/response schemas
- Pydantic schemas are not used for all API models
- mypy/type checking does not pass cleanly for all modules
- Sphinx/autodoc documentation is not fully set up or published
- API versioning and error response docs are not fully standardized

## Missing or Incomplete Items
- [ ] Add type hints and docstrings to all public functions and methods in backend services, repositories, and models
- [ ] Ensure all API endpoints are documented with OpenAPI/Swagger and have request/response schemas
- [ ] Use Pydantic schemas for all API request/response models
- [ ] Ensure mypy passes without errors for all backend modules
- [ ] Set up and publish Sphinx/autodoc documentation for backend
- [ ] Standardize API versioning and error response documentation
- [ ] Add more usage examples and doctests to documentation

## Next Steps
- Audit all backend modules for missing type hints and docstrings
- Integrate or update OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all endpoints
- Refactor API models to use Pydantic schemas everywhere
- Fix mypy errors and enforce type checking in CI
- Set up Sphinx/autodoc and publish backend docs
- Standardize API versioning and error docs
